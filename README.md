My first Advent of Code

## Day 1
A bit of a rough start - part 2's merged words like twone were really annyoning. Ended up just manually setting the specific merged words in my list to their number equivalents - other inputs might have more words.

## Day 2
A lot easier than day 1 in my opinion. Most time was spent on reading the file, which I've really got to work on since I feel like it was really ineffective. Part 2 especially was surprisingly simple.
