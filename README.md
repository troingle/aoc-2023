My first Advent of Code

## Day 1
A bit of a rough start - part 2's merged words like twone were really annyoning. Ended up just manually setting the specific merged words in my list to their number equivalents - other inputs might have more words.

## Day 2
A lot easier than day 1 in my opinion. Most time was spent on reading the file, which I've really got to work on since I feel like it was really ineffective. Part 2 especially was surprisingly simple.

## Day 3
Hardest one so far. Didn't know much about 2D arrays before this so learning them took a lot of time. Once I had figured them out, the rest of part 1 and part 2 were very easy except for one very annoying bug related to numbers being in the same line in part 2 which is why I haven't completed it yet. I'll probably fix it and complete part 2 tomorrow.
